# Nats JetStream Transport Module for NestJS

Build Event Driven Microservices Architecture with Nats JetSteam Server and NestJS.



- At-least-once delivery; exactly once within a window

- Store messages and replay by time or sequence

- Wildcard support

- Account aware

- Data at rest encryption

- Cleanse specific messages (GDPR)

- Horizontal scalability

- Persist Streams and replay via Consumers



## Install

```bash
npm i @nestjs/microservices
npm i @nestjs-plugins/nestjs-nats-jetstream-transport
```

## Runnin Nats Jetstream server in Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name nats-main -p 4222:4222 -p 6222:6222 -p 8222:8222 nats -js -m 8222
```

### ServerConsumerOptions



- **durable** (boolean, default: false) - Durable subscriptions remember their position even if the client is disconnected.

- **deliveryPolicy** (All | Last | New | ByStartSequence | ByStartTime | last_per_subject, default: All) - Specify where in the stream it wants to start receiving messages.

- **startSequence** (number) - If deliveryPolicy is set to ByStartSequence this will specify the sequence number to start on.

- startAtTimeDelta (number) - If If deliveryPolicy is set to ByStartTime this will specify a delta time in the stream at which to start.

- **startTime** (Date) - If deliveryPolicy is set to ByStartTime this will specify the time in the stream at which to start. It will receive the closest available message on or after that time.

- **deliverTo** (string) - Queue group, a balanced message delivery across a group of subscribers.

- **deliverToSubject** (string) - The subject to deliver observed messages. Not allowed for pull subscriptions. Deliver subject is required for queue subscribing as it configures a subject that all the queue consumers should listen on.

- **ackPolicy** (Explicit | All | None, default: Excplicit ) - How messages should be acknowledged. If an ack is required but is not received within the AckWait window, the message will be redelivered.

- **ackWait** (number, default: 30000 ) - the time in nanoseconds that the server will wait for an ack for any individual message. If an ack is not received in time, the message will be redelivered.

- **maxAckPending** (number, default: 1024) - The maximum number of messages the subscription will receive without sending back ACKs.

- **replayPolicy** (Instant All ByStartSequence ByStartTime, default: Instant) - The replay policy applies when the deliver policy is `All`, `ByStartSequence` or `ByStartTime` since those deliver policies begin reading the stream at a position other than the end. If the policy is `Original`, the messages in the stream will be pushed to the client at the same rate they were originally received, simulating the original timing of messages. If the policy is `Instant` (the default), the messages will be pushed to the client as fast as possible while adhering to the Ack Policy, Max Ack Pending and the clientâ€™s ability to consume those messages.

- maxDeliver (number, default: ?) - The maximum number of times a specific message will be delivered. Applies to any message that is re-sent due to ack policy.
